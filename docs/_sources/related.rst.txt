==========================================================

**torchfunc** is PyTorch oriented library with a goal to help you with:

* Improving and analysing performance of your neural network
* Plotting and visualizing modules
* Record neuron activity and tailor it to your specific task or target
* Get information about your host operating system, CUDA devices and others
* Day-to-day neural network related duties (model size, seeding, performance measurements etc.)

It **is not** directly related with model creation but should be considered more of an environment
around this process. 

You can read documentation over at https://szymonmaszke.github.io/torchfunc.
